CFIT is a tool to perform a template fit with including
systematic uncertainties in a correlation matrix. Systematic
correlations between templates are taken into account. The tool also
allows one to estimate statistical and systematic uncertainties
on the fit parameters and to perform the measurement of the scale factors.

To create a python wrapper please run: ./buildPyLib.sh
Make sure you specify the correct path to your python installation.
The built library is _cfit.so with documented methods can be found in
a newly created cfit.py

Documentation is [available](./doc/doc.pdf)
